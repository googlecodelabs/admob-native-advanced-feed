AdMob Native Advanced Ads in a Feed Codelab
============================================
Native is a component-based ad format that gives publishers the freedom
to customize how ad assets like headlines and calls to action are
presented in their apps. By choosing fonts, colors, and other details
for themselves, publishers are able to create natural, unobtrusive ad
presentations that can add to a rich user experience.

This codelab will walk you through using Native Advanced ads within a
`RecyclerView` or `UITableView`, to show you how to monetize a feed-based
app. You'll start with an app that displays a list of items (current sample
uses dishes from a menu), but no ads. Over the course of the codelab, you’ll
add code to handle two new types of items (app install and content ads),
and display them correctly.
